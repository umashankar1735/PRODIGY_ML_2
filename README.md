# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Overview

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history to better understand customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Mall Customers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID for each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned to the customer by the mall

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Setup

1. **Download the Dataset:**

   Ensure you have the Kaggle API set up and use it to download the dataset, or manually download it from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

2. **Place the Dataset:**

   Save the dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) in the same directory as this project or update the file path in the code accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Load and Prepare Data:**

   The data is loaded from a CSV file, and categorical columns are converted to numeric where necessary.

2. **Standardize the Data:**

   Features are standardized to ensure that the clustering algorithm works effectively.

3. **Fit K-Means Model:**

   The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied with a specified number of clusters (e.g., 5). The resulting clusters are added to the dataset.

4. **Analyze Results:**

   Aggregate statistics by cluster are calculated to understand the characteristics of each cluster. Results are printed and can be visualized.

5. **Visualization:**

   A scatter plot shows the clusters and their centers, helping to visualize how customers are grouped.

## Example

To run the analysis, use the provided Python script (`kmeans_clustering.py`):

```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py
```

## Code Explanation

- **Data Preprocessing:** Converts categorical data to numeric and scales numeric features.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups customers into clusters based on standardized features.
- **Aggregation:** Computes mean and count statistics for each cluster.
- **Visualization:** Plots clusters and centroids to visually interpret the segmentation.
